1- Simplification of games: O(N)
    * Remove sub-games which are inverse of each other. G + (-G) = 0
    * Remove sub-games which show symmetry. Second player win by strategy stealing.
    * Remove all sub-games with single type of elements. (because all are 0 games)
    * Remove (.) at the end of the board. 
    * Replace multiple (.) with single (.)
2- Improve ordering.
    * Play sub-game from the middle. Increases chances of occurrence of situations mentioned in 1.
